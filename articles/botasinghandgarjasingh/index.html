            <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
            <p>
Now let us bear witness to the great event that occured in the land of Majha with Bota Singh Garja Singh. Zakriya khan was the governor of Lahore, as as a result governed all of Panjab. Under his rule, we see perhaps the height of Sikh persecution. Under his orders the government imposes a prize if anyone brings the head of a Sikh to the governor. Under his rule 10 rupees were paid to anyone who was able to give the whereabouts of a Sikh. 50 rupees were given to anyone who brought the decapitated head of a Sikh. 100 rupees were given to anyone who captured a live Sikh and brought them to governer. Zakriya would execute the Sikhs by collecting them from village to village and using various methods, like beheading, burying alive, drowning, smashing their heads in grinders, putting them on spiked wheels, boiling them alive, etc. As a result Singhs spent their times in isolated jungles. They lived in caves, dug out shelters in river banks, in forests, and places where it was hard for humans to survive. Some went to the mountains up north and lived in snowy conditions while some travelled to rajasthan and bikaner and lived in the desert dunes. Very few were the Singhs who stayed in Punjab. There was a saying at the time “patta patta singhan da vairi” essentially meaning every leaf to leaf there was an enemy of the Singhs. Under every pebble was someone giving the government information about the singhs and their hideouts. (Personal note: in these tough times, singhs still kept their discipline, hair, tied their dastar, beat their drums twice a day, read endless Gurbani, stayed strapped with weapons, always in rising spirits and ready to battle. In todays time, there is no spiked wheels, no beheadings, we have good clothes, heated showers, air conditioned houses, shelter on our heads, but we roam bareheaded forgetting the message of the guru and the sacrifices of our ancestors.) Due to all these persecutions at the time, very very few singhs lived in Punjab. They lived in marshes and unlivable conditions, coming out at nights to hunt for their food. Zakirya gave them no option to light even a fire to cook their food and Singhs consumed boars and deer raw in the jungles, sometimes surviving off of just leaves. Hunger was such an issue that the singhs would tighten their waistband so tight on their abdomen, in an attempt to distract from the hunger, that when they went to take it off, skin would come off with it. Under these harsh times Bota Singh and Garja Singh were two singhs who decided to live in the land of Punjab.            </p>

            <h2 id="story">Story of Bota Singh Garja Singh</h2>
            <p>
Bota Singh and Garja Singh were two braveheart Singhs who sacrificed their heads upon hearing the slander of the Khalsa. To show the panth was still alive, and to announce to the world that the panth of guru Gobind Singh Ji was still alive, they gave their heads. Both of them were ready upon ready at all times strapped with weapons. Compassionate at heart and brave, always they remained in the bliss of Gurbani. Despite the harsh times they lived in bliss in the jungles of Majha. When Zakriya had killed an unnumerable amount of Singhs, the government could not even count how many they had executed. In the nikhas square of Lahore, there was a pyramid the size of the fort, made of just Singh’s skulls for public display. During this time, the people of Punjab stopped hearing the news of the singhs. Because many had left Punjab and the rest stayed in hiding, the inhabitants of Punjab, and the government started saying the singhs were finally extinct! They were no more! No news of the singhs no clue of the singhs were found. The people started chattering that the singhs could not survive and the Turks had wiped them out. These rumors spread across the land. In the land of Majha there was a strict law against singhs under Zakriya and all of Punjab was basically empty of singhs. However, one day Bota Singh and Garja Singh were spotted living in the Jungles of taran tarn by some soldiers of the Mughals army. Two Mughal scouts, while travelling, looked and spotted what seemed like two Singhs sitting hidden in the jungles and moving around minimally. As soon as they saw the singhs, they were amazed and surprised. They had thought the singhs were wiped out! How are they alive when zakirya left none of them alive! Then the scouts uttered something. They said “leave it, they are probably some beggars in disguise going from village to village collecting money”. The scouts are talking to themselves loudly saying “the Singhs are no more and have went extinct.” One scout said “maybe they are singhs, but cowards who are living in hiding trying to save their lives” The scouts said “we had thought the singhs were the ones forever engaged in warfare and not scared of dying. Ones that sacrifice their heads these can’t be singhs”
As soon as Bota Singh heard these piercing remarks bhai rattan Singh bhangu writes (translated to English) : As if some scorpion had stung them, the scout’s remarks pierced the conscience of Bota Singh and pained him that much.
Bota Singh immediately decided, now the only option was to sacrifice his head. Read in amazement the respect they had for the reputation of the Khalsa.            </p>

            <h2 id="sovereignty">Sovereignty of the Khalsa</h2>
            <p>
                Bota Singh immediately decided it was time to create new history and engage in battle, as is the job of the Khalsa. It is time to prove the Turks liars by breaking the clay prison of this human body. Only then will the Turks and people of Punjab know that the Khalsa lives and remains sovereign! Zakriya may know too! The Singh’s utter “Raj karega Khalsa Akki rahe na koi” and make this decision. We may be familiar with the famous GT road, the most important road of Indias history that spans from Delhi to Amritsar and then to Lahore. On this very road there is a village called noordin di Saran. In this village, the Singhs created a toll plaza. They took over the toll plaza of the Turks and made them flee, creating some chaos. They made sure that the message reaches Zakriya fast, because the road was used by travelers going to Lahore. For the first two days, the Singhs claimed their autonomy. When travelers approached, they told them it is the Khalsas raj, and tax would need to be collected. A coin was issued if a donkey was to pass and a dime for a cart. Those without money were made to draw lines on the ground with their nose and flee back where they came from. For the first 2 days no resistance was found. The Singhs were of incredible stature and the common folk were afraid and complied. Then The Singhs decided they would write a letter to Zakriya as well, which would ignite fire under his feet.            </p>

            <h2 id="letter">Letter of Bota Singh Garja Singh</h2>
            <p>
                The singhs wrote a letter and gave it to a messenger and told him to deliver it by hand to the governer Zakriya. The messenger complied out of fear. Bota Singh writes such a letter which would immediately prompt the governer to send his army to capture them. In the letter he writes:

                “I am Bota Singh, writing this message to you zakirya. I carry a large stick in my hand, and I am standing in your road in the village noordin di Saran. I have charged an anna (dollar) for a cart and a paisa (coin) for a donkey. You cannot run the government. You are an unintelligent donkey. Tell bhabi khanno (bhabi khanno meaning zakriyas wife), that your husband is Singh Bota.”            </p>

            <h2 id="army-sent">Letter is Read, Army is Sent</h2>
            <p>
                As soon as Zakriya reads this message he is flooded by rage and sends an army of 100 soldiers to capture the two Singhs. The soldiers immediately left Lahore, reached the singhs, and surrounded them. Garja singh was going to use the restroom when Bota Singh saw the army and Bellowed a jaikara at the top of his lungs, prompting Garja Singh to come back. Bota Singh said “ready up brother Garja, our prey is here”. They referred to the bushes as their fort. They became ready upon ready, as blood entered their eyes. Their muscles twitched and mustaches curled. What weapons did they have? Swords slung over the shoulders and long sticks in their hands. One Singh had a simple spear. The singhs came out of the bushes and revealed their 6.5 foot chiseled bodies. They had a kachera on the knees and dumalla on the head. They had no clothes as they could not go anywhere and buy them. The Khalsa always had this form back then. Sword, spear, kachera, dumalla, sticks. This is what the singhs of the time lived by.
                The commander of the army said “Bota Singh this life is precious and your body is beautiful, don’t waste it. Renounce your weapons and come with me and go to Zakriya. You can ask for forgiveness and he will spare you. I will appeal for you it is my responsibility” The Singhs said “oh commander if we wanted to spare our lives, why did we call you here in the first place?  We called you because we want to become shaheed. They announced that the caste and creed of the singhs is to battle and challenged the army of 100 to approach them.” “Come get off your horse and I’ll show you how a general fight. Come fight me 1v1 and I’ll show you have warriors wage war.” The Turks had nice weapons rifles, arrows, canons, horses, expensive swords, metal spears, pistols. The Singhs said “we have these sticks you have your weapons. Approach us! We’ll dispatch you to hell with our sticks. We are the yamdoots of this world! Come see the miracle of our sticks and see how they serve you. We’ll see how much strength the Turks have in their arms and how much the Khalsa has” the commander said again “you still have time. I will make an appeal” the singh said again “what relation do we have? What court is there in this world, we will have court in the life after. Our relation here is with weapons.” The commander then says “we are warning you. You can become Muslim and we will save you”            </p>

            <h2 id="battle">Battle Begins</h2>
            <p>
                When Bota Singh heard the accursed remark of the commander saying they can become Muslim, he approached the army of 100 alone bloodlusted. Garja Singh joins in. Wherever the singhs went, the Turks fled from that area. They knew the prowess of the singhs. The singhs used their sticks or used rocks from the ground with self made slingshots. They would open the heads of the Turks with their rocks. The Turks wanted to save their lives, the Singhs wanted to sacrifice it. Bota Singh said we are two, send 4 of your best men. 4 Turks approached and the singhs joined backs. All 4 were killed immediately. Then they sent 5 Turks, who also died. When the first 9 died the commander thought at this rate they’ll finish everyone, and sent a larger attack on the two Singhs. Wherever the weapons of Turks would approach from, the singhs went there, they didn’t attempt to save their bodies, but accepted death and considered their injuries blessings. Running with incredible velocity they smashed the heads of the Turks with their sticks, extracting the brains from their skulls. The Singh’s bodies began getting pierced by bullets, arrows, spears. As this happened, they celebrated. As if players were playing kabaddi the singhs were jumping in battle celebrating as they sustained injuries.
                The Turks wanted to run the singhs over with their horses. Sometimes the singhs would fall, immediately getting up. They would smash the horses legs with their sticks, making the Turk fall, then would smash the Turks head, making mincemeat of them. Swords, spears, bullets, were piercing their skin, but they became happier. When the arrows pierced their bodies, they plucked them out, making sure the Turks saw them do this, and said “futile are your arrows, they can’t pierce our skin!” They would throw them to the side and challenge them to shoot more arrows. As they bodies began to bleed out, they rubbed the blood on their bodies in a scary fashion, as if bathing. The Turks came with their swords, and the singhs stopped the swords with their sticks. (Personal note: in gatka, a stick beats a sword. A sword can break and a stick is longer. If someone is experienced the stick fighter wins.)
                The Singhs hit with such strength they smashed the shields of the Turks. The 100 Turks retreated in defeat against the 2 singhs. They retreated and aimed with their rifles. As they aim with their rifles the singhs use their training and change their feet positioning. Zigzagging, they dodge the bullets, which narrowly miss them on. With the blessing of the shaheed singhs the bullets missed. But when a lot of bullets came some were destined to hit them. Their bones broke due to the bullets. With their right hands injured the singhs would with their left hand, still now allowing the Turks to trap them. With bullets the Singh’s legs were broken. The singhs could not walk anymore. Seeing this the Turks stopped.            </p>

            <h2 id="shaheedi">Shaheedi</h2>
            <p>
                When the Turks saw the singhs could not walk anymore, the commander spoke once again “your body still has life. Lay your weapons and come with me I’ll appeal for you. we will keep you as Muslim brothers”
                When the Turk mentioned turning them to Islam bota singh used his stick as a crutch wobbling onto one leg and bellowed “Come here, let me show you how a Muslim is made!” Even with broken legs the Singhs continued to kill the Turks. Then, with all the injuries, the singhs were half unconscious and they collapsed. They continued to crawl towards the Turks thirsty for more blood and did not break eye contact. They still did not show pain. The singhs said “this is what our ancestors have taught us to be cut piece to piece but not falter in the battlefield. This is our religion.” When the singhs could not even crawl anymore the Turks released their frustration. The singhs had killed half the army of 100. The Turks chopped and hacked the 2 singhs into hundreds of small pieces. Chopping arm, leg, head, elbow, knee. They scattered the Singh’s pieces around the jungle out of fear that they do not reconnect with some magical powers, such was the fear they had for the singhs.            </p>

            <h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
            <p>
                In this manner, the two singhs achieved martyrdom. Today there is a beautiful gurdwara Built in memory to the two singhs in that village where the battle occured, no insignia of the Mughals remains however. Blessed are the mother and father of Bota Singh and Garja Singh, who gave birth to these lions. The singhs immediately joined the 96 crore shaheed singh fauj and news of their battle spread through the land of Punjab. The governer, the army, the people of Punjab, found out that the Khalsa was still in fact alive, and not extinct. And it will forever remain so. May the shaheeds forever remain with us, and may we learn from their endeavors.            </p>
