            <h2 id="context-background">Context and Background</h2>
            <p>
When banda bahadur engaged in his battles with the Mughals after the passing of guru Gobind Singh Ji, baba Tara Singh waan came to help Banda bahadur win these battles at the order of guru. When Banda bahadur toppled cities like Samara, sandhaura, and many other battles, eventually sacking sirhand and killing wazir khan, who executed the smaller sahibzade, baba Tara Singh ji participated in all of these battles. They participated at the forefront, killing thousands of enemies. When Banda bahadur eventually came to carve out a small area of land out of Punjab which the Sikhs ruled over. The Mughals diverted all their forces, captured Banda bahadur, and made him shaheed. Following this the dispute between the bandais and tat Khalsa ensued. The bandais thought Banda bahadur was their 11th guru, and they rejected the authority of the tat Khalsa being the descendent, often engaging in conflict with them. The Mughals were smart, and recognized this. Following this period the bandais were the main ones conspiring to overthrow the Mughals, because they had power, wealth, and had amassed a large army with the provisions of Banda bahadur. The Mughals targeted the Bandais and the tat Khalsa did not interfere as it was a common enemy. Soon the Bandais were wiped out, and this event had set sort of a stage for the Khalsa to have some agreements with the Mughals. The Mughals wanted to keep the tat Khalsa cool and buttered them constantly. They started giving the Singh’s allotments of lands. Some Singh would get 10 acres some would get 20. The Mughals urged them to continue farming, serving langar, and reciting Nitnem and bani. They did anything in their power to keep the Khalsa from retaliating. In every way the Mughals tried to keep the Singhs calm by giving them horses and food rations. The Mughals recognized the superiority of the tat Khalsa over the Bandai Khalsa. They realized that if the Bandai was this hard to wipe out, then the tat would be impossible. They recognized that the tat Khalsa had been born out of the sword, and  engage in conflict with them, when they could be kept calm, would be foolish. In these days, mahakal akaali baba Tara Singh waan nihang was also given a couple of acres to sit, farm, and recite bani.

            <h2 id="description">Description of Nihang Akaali Tara Singh Waan</h2>
            <p>
Baba Tara Singh Waan is born in the village of Waan in the family of Buttar Jatts. In this village, Tara Singh was known all around as a very ferocious warrior. Awakening everyday at midnight, Babaji sat in concentration of the naam and recited bani until sunrise, never breaking his routine. Always adorning blue robes, he stayed strapped in numerous dangerous weapons. He constantly inspected his firearms and weapons and maintained them to the highest regard, staying ready upon ready or tyar bar tyar. They tied a tall blue dumalla with a Farla on top, which was decorated in chakkars, blades, and steel chains. With pure rehit this Singh lived his life. They kept the gurus bani in their heart 24 hours out of the day. All day they engaged in naam Simran and seva. All they trusted was guru Nanak ji. Anything they uttered from their mouth, they would go as far as sacrifice their head to prove. Never would his speech prove fruitless, as is the way of warriors. Out of the warriors in the countryside, he was known as being in the forefront and was always in the eyes of the Mughals. Baba Tara Singh Waan had received darshan of the 10th guru and took Amrit from them. Tara Singh loved fighting so much, if a fight or argument would be in someone else’s house, he would shout “come over to my side as well”. He constantly kept his life in the palm of his hand and was never afraid of dying. He exclaimed “let death come whenever. If it is to come tomorrow then so be it. If it is to come today, then may it come now.” He stayed ready 24/7 decorated head to bottom in weapons ready for a battle. Tara Singh had built a bunga or tower with battle positions in his own front yard. Where his house was, he had a tall tower about 5 stories high constructed, so an advantageous position was available in the instance of an attack. He would always have some sort of fight ignited and would often be involved in quarrels. He kept 5-10 ferocious Singhs with him at all times as well. If the Singhs would come and tell baba ji that some altercation happened, Babaji would become happy and look after them. When others would come with complains of the singhs, he would be filled with joy and tell them that it was their job to do so. Death was scared of this singh baba Tara Singh waan. He did not recognize the power of the Turks and said who are these Mughals to give us allotments, we own the entire world. We are playing along with them for the time being. In the absence of conflict Tara Singh waan become stressed. He exclaimed, without conflict how can we ransack Delhi and Lahore. How can we attain shaheedi. We cannot sit on our hands. He thought his life was wasting away without conflict.

            <h2 id="shaheedi-background">Background to Shaheedi of Tara Singh Waan</h2>
            <p>
                Now listen how the battles started and the 5 years of peace with the Singhs ended. In the village of nowshera, there was a choudhary or governer that lived and had great power. He was employed by the Turks and often engaged in nefarious acts. He specifically targeted the Sikhs indirectly. He would let his horses loose into the poor Sikhs fields. In this town lived two Sikhs who had a few acres of land and were poor. The governer, Sahib Rai pannu, would let his horses loose into their land and they would eat all the crops of the Sikh. The Sikhs complained that their children would have no grain to eat and there would be no income for them at this rate. The Sikhs approached the governer and told him to tie up his horses kindly. They approached with kindness and the Choudhary stated egoistically “Yes I’ll tie them. But I will first cut your long hair and make ropes with it. Then I will use the rope made of your hair to tie my horses.” When he claimed he would shave the beard and heads of the Sikhs they became very hurt. Sikhs cannot hear any foul talk about their hair. They thought to themselves there is no way to go now, he has no shame. We have families, how will we take care of them? They thought to themselves, if our kids didn’t live here, we could kill the governer ourselves, but it would damage our kids and families. Close to the pind of nowshera where this happened, there is a village called Bhussa. They went there.
            </p>

            <h2 id="nowshera-sikhs">Sikhs from Nowshera Approach Baghel Singh and Amar Singh</h2>
            <p>
                In this pind of Bhussa there was two Singh’s who were very clever and knew how to do illegal activities. The Sikhs from nowshera approached baghel Singh and Amar Singh who agreed to steal the horses of the governer of Nowshera. The horses were done and sold to a merchant, who then took the horses across the river and sold them to the king of Patiala, maharaja Ala Singh. This money earned by baghel singh and Amar Singh was then put into the langar of Baba Tara Singh Waan. Eventually, sahib rai the governer employed his investigators and detectives. They tracked the footsteps of the horses and talked to people and connected the dots. The dots lined up and the accused turned out to be Tara Singh Waan. The detectives found that baghel singh and Amar Singh were the thieves and that they operated under the power of Tara Singh Waan, who was already very well known in the country side. Baghel Singh and Amar Singh stayed with Tara Singh because they knew some conflict would happen.
            </p>

            <h2 id="preface-battle">Preface to Battle</h2>
            <p>
                The governer of nowshera sahib rai approached with a small army to the village of Waan where Tara Singh was staying. He came straight to Tara Singh and exclaimed “Oh Tara Singh. What are you doing. You are hiding thiefs? Hand them over to me and I’ll take them to Lahore. If you do not give the thieves over I will go to Lahore anyways and bring a large army back. If you don’t want to give them over then keep them, when my army comes, the thieves will run and you will have to deal with me alone.” Then Tara Singh the braveheart replied “ Thieves are not these Singhs. You are the thief, who is ruining the farmland of the poor Sikhs in your area. The grain that will go into their children’s mouths you have your horses eat it. You are the thief. These are the singhs of the gurus who recite bani. They have done justice by robbing from you. You bring the nawab zakriya, better yet bring his father. My life is already on my palm what care do I have. Who can kill someone who has already died? When we took khande di Pahul, we vowed to behead the Turks and become shaheed. We weren’t born to run and hide. We stand with our chest abroad and we will set an example that Zakriya will remember” The two, sahib Rai the governer and Baba Tara Singh Waan continued to quarrel back and forth and the argument escalated to a great degree. Imagine as if the time for shaheedi had come. The opportunity for shaheedi had been built in the mind of Tara Singh.
                The governer went to the nearest big city, which was Patti. He went to the police station and said you guys are sitting here in peace, but the Singhs are robbing us. You want us to give you tax in your kingdom, Tara Singh has became rebellious in his own land. The general there became very intrigued and worried about who was doing this in his kingdom. The general asked where the Singhs were, that robbed him. He replied they live in Waan pind and his last name is Buttar. He has created a large tower there and waves a tall blue Nishan or flag there. He lives proudly without fear. The general asked him, “How much power does he have. How many Singhs or soldiers?” The governer replied Tara Singh has no large army and no fort for fighting. He has 1-2 buildings where 10-20 singhs live with him. 5-10 others come and go. At most it is 30 singhs that live with him. Some of the singhs keep a spear while some wear a sword around their chest. Some live without many major weapons who just serve in the kitchen and langar there. Hearing this, the general immediately left with sahib rai the governer and with his army to Tara Singhs village. He brought with him 80 soldiers on foot and 25 people on horseback. With 105 total soldiers he left to capture Tara Singh.
                With great planning he left with a lot of speed and made sure to arrive there when the Singhs would be sleeping. Little did that fool know that singhs are already up by midnight and the first thing they do is become tyar bar tyar or ready upon ready with weapons. They recite bani all night long. He was not aware of the rehit of the singhs and hoped to catch them by surprise. He hoped to tie them down, ship them to Lahore, and collect a prize from zakriya            </p>

            <h2 id="initial-skirmish">Initial Skirmish</h2>
            <p>
                In the village of Waan,  Baghel Singh, one of the Singhs who stole the horses, was ready to use the restroom right before the army arrived. He took his pot of water and left the village heading to the Forrest to pass his daily stool. He was about half a kilometer away from the village when he heard the sounds of horse hooves. This Singh was alone in the pitch dark going to use the restroom. Baghel Singh had a sword on his chest, shield on his back, spear in his hand, double barrel rifle on his side, with a various assortment of blades, pistols, and daggers in his waistband. (Personal note: in today’s generation we see a lot of Singhs doing many unnecessary things like tying their sword to their dastar when using the restroom, or taking the bare minimum of weapons inside the restroom. I understand the respect but the first priority is readiness. Old Singhs and knowledgeable singhs today are always ready, even when using restroom or bathing)
                Baghel Singh had a sarbloh pot of water in his left hand and a spear in his right hand. When he heard the hooves of the horses he pieced everything together and thought to himself:
                If I go back to inform the Singhs in the village, they will think I got scared and ran away from the battlefield. They will say that he started everything and ran away himself. He thought they will find out themselves when I create chaos with my rifle. Hearing the sound of these fireworks from my rifle they will find out themselves.
                Thinking this Baghel Singh readies up alone, ready to battle the army of 105 Turks.            </p>

            <h2 id="battle-begins">Battle Begins</h2>
            <p>
                Baghel Singh bellowed a sky piercing war cry of “SATSRIAKALUHH” and said “where are you going, your groom is standing here” Sahib Rai the governer immediately recognized the voice, and said “Oh general the cause of the whole conflict is right here. He is the one who stole my horses! He is a very ferocious warrior in the Singhs. If we kill him half our task will be finished!” The general launched his attack and Baghel Singh immediately discharged both bullets in his rifle, hitting two Turks in the forehead and laying them out bloody on the ground. Then Baghel Singh pounced right into the middle of the army like a lion in a herd of deer. The army of 100 tried to aim at Baghel Singh, but because he was already in the midst of them with cheetah like velocity, their weapons started killing their own soldiers. It was pitch dark and nobody could figure out where to attack. The Turks failed to estimate how many Singhs were fighting. It was only one, but seemed like 10, but in reality this was the power of the 96 crore shaheed Singhs, who had also entered the battlefield now. Baghel Singh struck some Turks with his spear and some with his sword. He throws Turks off their horses and smashes their heads. One nephew of the general was also killed in this chaos. Who knows who killed this nephew but the play unfolded, victory belonged to Baghel Singh it was guru and the shaheeds themselves helping the lone Singh. When soldiers cornered Baghel Singh from all 4 sides they chopped his limbs and shot their pistols.
                When the sound of the gunfire reached the Singhs in the village of Waan, Tara Singh and his Singh’s polished their swords and rifles and ran to the scene of the battle. As soon as they arrived, they let out a barrage of gunfire, sending the army of 100 running without their shoes. Two nephews and two brothers of the general died and he ran injured from the battle as well. With about half the soldiers he arrived with, he ran from the scene and went straight to Lahore. He didn’t even go to Patti, but straight to Zakriya after he saw his whole family was killed. In this skirmish, Baghel Singh Ji joined the 96 crore shaheedi fauj after his martyrdom. Today there is a large nihang Singh encampment in this place in memory of them. One Singh became shaheed, but about 50 Turks died in the chaos.            </p>

            <h2 id="turk-preparations">Turk Preparations</h2>
            <p>
                The general had arrived to Zakriya Khan. He cried and made a huge scene. He told him his plight and Zakriya became enraged. As the general said the names of the Singhs and their actions, Zakriya became more and more frustrated. As if gunpowder on fire, was the scene that ensued. Zakriya said, how is this possible, I barely defeated banda bahadur, why are they now rebellious again. I had given them allotments of land. It is just in their nature. Zakriya sent 2200 soldiers to go capture the 22 singhs under the command of Momin khan. He sent 40 small canons and 5 elephants. As well as 5 larger canons. Sikhs in Lahore found out of these preparations and sent their messengers secretly before the army could leave. They reached there by midnight and came to tell Tara Singh the immense preparations Zakriya had made, but upon seeing the bloody eyes and curled mustaches of the Singhs in the village, they knew not a word needed to be said. The messengers returned back to Lahore by daybreak.
                After hearing a large army was approaching, Tara Singhs face glowed red with joy.            </p>

            <h2 id="shaheedi">Shaheedi of Mahakal Akaali Baba Tara Singh Waan and Other Singhs</h2>
            <p>
                Momin khan approaches the Singhs in the middle of the night, once again trying to catch the singhs off guard while they are sleeping. As they arrive in the village the villagers get concerned and start reasoning with the army, telling them not to cause any destruction of their houses or their family members. As they were reasoning and some villagers were urging Tara Singh to leave still, the singhs beat the battle drum loud and clear on the other side of the village during their nitnem. The sound of the drum immediately reached the ears of the army and they readied up. The singhs were also ready upon ready.
                The Turks recognized from the sound where the singhs were stationed and turned their horses towards them. Like the Brahmins body become holy by bathing at the ganga river, the singhs body becomes pure and holy by sustaining injuries with weapons. Tara Singh was getting water from the well, when he heard the horses about half a kilometer away. As soon as he sees them he bellows a jaikara of “SATSRIAKAL” and readies all the singhs. He orders them to ready their weapons and to put their rosaries to the side. All 22 singhs unsheathe their swords, load their rifles, and glisten their blades, exiting their buildings. They bellow jaikaras.
                The Turks also played their drums and horns and so did the singhs. As if players are playing kabaddi, the singhs danced and pounced in the battlefield. First Balaka Singh ran ahead of all the singhs approaching the army of 2200 alone. With great speed he moved forward in battle, his biceps flexed and mustaches curled. He immediately beheaded 7-10 Turks and injured 10 more. Balaka Singh sustained hundreds of arrows and bullets on his chest and attained shaheedi. Bhai Balaka Singh was the first shaheed of this battle and he joined the 96 crore shaheedi fauj.
                Some Singhs climbed to the tower where they fired rifles and arrows, while some singhs made walls of sandbags on the ground, using them as cover. While one Singh would fire his gun, the other Singh would reload and they would repeat. Some singhs fortified the rear by moving carts and sandbags and more supplies, a project which they had started yesterday. This was to prevent a rear flank. The Turks faces were shattered by the singhs on their initial wave. With so many horses running, there was great dust in the air. It was already pitch dark and the dust in the air increased this darkness. The Turks rush towards the singhs with their horses, in an attempt to knock them over by bumping them. The singhs strike with such power, they behead the horses and chop their mouths and legs. Many horses and bodies of Turks litter the battlefield. Only bhai Balaka Singh lays shaheed on the Singh’s side.
                Because the turks had so many people, they trampled each other and were forced to come to a standstill. As the Turks fired their rifles and arrows, Singhs would become shaheed as well after having killed 20-30 themselves. Many Turks began to fight amongst themselves in the dark and many fell from their horses. The 96 crore shaheeds had entered into the battlefield. Some Turks ran back seeing 10 foot tall Singh’s, which were in reality shaheed singhs. On both sides the blood and guts on the ground formed mud in battlefield, which the horses slipped on, crushing Turks underneath them.
                With great might warriors from both sides became tired and came to a standstill. The Turks sent their next wave, while the singhs downed another cauldron of shaheedi degh, or the sacred cannabis drink. The Turks would not come battle the Singh’s hand to hand with sword and dagger, because they recognized the singhs were superior. The fired from afar with canons and rifles. The singhs change their footwork and dodge even these with the help of the 96 crori fauj. The singhs did not have many ranged weapons and their arrows had ran out. But the play of the lord was such that the Turks bullets were killing their own Turks. Then Momin khan the commander approached himself. He launched another big wave of attack. There was a junior general of Momin khan called takki begh who comes forward egoistically with his horse. He bellows asking where Tara Singh is challenging him. Tara Singh yelled come forward here I am. When he bellowed like this, he said you attack first to the Turk. Takki begh had bow and arrow and fired one towards Tara Singh waan. Tara Singh’s fortified dumalla studded with metal chakkars and daggers stopped the arrow. God saved Tara Singh. Tara Singh pounced like an adult male lion and grabbed the reins of takki begh. Tara Singh saw that takki beghs whole body was covered with metal. From head to toe. In the span of a second h quickly analyzed any opening for attack and shoved his sword down Takki Begh’s throat, smashing his teeth. Takki begh returns back to Momin khan, who was sitting on an elephant. He asked “are you chewing paan betel leaves?” Takki begh replied crying “Yes, Tara Singh is ahead distributing these betel leaves. You also approach him he will give you some. You stand afar! Go near them and see how they strike.”
                Another junior general ran towards the singhs on his elephant. He told the driver of the elephant to move his elephant forward, equipped with rifle and arrows. He was such a warrior that he could fire 2 arrows at once. He thought he was sitting on an elephant, how could they reach him as they had ran out of ammunition and arrows. He became happy seeing the Singhs were few only about 10 in total now. He fires 2 arrows at once over and over. Then Bhima Singh saw the elephant and ran towards it. He grabbed the elephants ear pinching its nerves and pulled it down, making the elephant bow down. After the elephant bowed, its driver brought his spear ahead and broke the sword of Bhima Singh as he was swinging it. The Singh’s sword broke but not his resilience, and he decapitated the driver with just half his sword. Bhima Singh gained command of the elephant and Tara Singh and Lakhmir Singh approached to help. Tara Singh hilariously says “Oh Lakhmir Singh, do you remember when you used to hop 2 buffalos at once as a young child. Now this calf of the Turks is nothing.” He hilariously refers to the elephant as a calf and tells him to climb the elephant and kill the general. Lakhmir Singh swoops like a falcon with his spear and sends it through the generals shoulder. With the shoulder finished the general couldn’t fire his arrows or swing his sword and the general was minced in the battle and chopped into pieces.
                Lakhmir Singh captures the elephant and brings it back to the singhs. Tara Singh says “Wonderful, we now have an elephant. We’ll ride elephants now. Take care of it and raise it.” They are battling knowing they are going to die and are referring to the elephant as an investment. Lakhmir Singh replied “one elephant! Oh Tara Singh the khalsa will own thousands of elephants when it rules the world!” And these remarks were made true in the future.
                When the elephant was stolen, the Turks feet were shaken. The 2200 Turks were made to turn back by the 22 singhs. Half the night had passed.
                Two strong Turk generals were sent forward then. They were named Daya ram and Mansa ram. They attacked Tara Singh. The two generals were killed right away. The Turks army was once again retreating! The battlefield was commanded by the singhs.
                By now the Sun had come up. The suns light nourished the earth. In this daybreak, the Turks saw that were was only a couple of Singhs standing scattered. They thought to themselves it’s only a few, we thought there was hundreds. In the sunlight, they were able to fire their rifles from afar, but were afraid to approach them with sword still. In this way the other singhs took hundreds of of bullets in their chest and joined the 96 crori fauj. In this way the 22 singhs obtained shaheedi by day break. Huge Turk generals were killed in the battle and nearly 1000 more Turks were killed. No singh ran from the battlefield.            </p>

                In this way, in the year 1725, 17 years after joti jot of the 10th guru, the singhs fought this battle. News of the battle reached all the budha dal fauj in India and they prepared more than ever before. They gathered their small encampments and fortified Budha dal into one large army that gathered at Amritsar. News of the battle spread all throughout majha, Punjab, then India, and even foreign countries. Turks in Afghanistan and Chinese in China began to hear of the sword of the singhs. This battle would set the stage for all future conflicts with the Turks and the singhs. From this time on, Zakriya khan would begin his era of immense persecution of the singhs. Through the persecution of the singhs, the more that died, the more would be born. Dhan shaheed mahakal akaali Tara Singh waan nihang and all the shaheeds. The world is for souls to come and go, only your actions remain. May we walk on their paths and continue to obtain inspiration from them.            </p>
